&emsp;[OpenAI app - https://mkportfolio.link//](https://mkportfolio.link/)

<br>

## Usage and Temrs of Use

 Usage
1. Register your name and password.
2. Go to the service page [Image Generator, GPT Handler, Audio Scriptor]
3. Make the setting if you need from Setting button.
   
 Note
- Because of the API cost meter, I have set up a usage limit (apologies).
- Therefore, you can use each service only once. This applies even if someone else has accessed this app from the same IP address and has already used the service more than once.
- If you would like to exceed these limits, please contact me via LinkedIn. I would be pleased to consider lifting the restrictions.

	Enabling users to check API request responses tied to their own accounts.
- Image Download Feature:
	Addition of a feature for downloading images within the app.
- Introduction of CICD:
	Adoption of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment using AWS CodePipeline and Codebuild.
- Expansion of User Management Functions:
	Addition of user deletion and modification features.
- Optimization of Deployment Methods:
	Deployment of the static app on AWS S3.
	Configuration of the server side using AWS Lambda and API Gateway.

## Deploy Steps on your Local Machine

&emsp;First, you'll need to set up a Docker environment on your machine. Once done, run the following command in the root directory of the app:

```
docker-compose up
```

&emsp;Thanks to the inclusion of the "Concurrently" module, both client and server-side applications will run simultaneously.

&emsp;Lastly, ensure you have a .env file in the app's root directory. Define SESSION_SECRET with a random string and CHATGPT_APIKEY. Note: An API key from OpenAI is required, which might be paid.
